# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Data-Preprocessing

## Overview

This repository contains the data preprocessing steps for a Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) dataset. The goal is to clean and prepare the data for further analysis or machine learning model development.

## Features

- Handling missing values using different imputation methods (mean, mode, and random sampling).
- Encoding categorical variables using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
- Feature scaling (Normalization or Standardization) to bring features to a comparable scale.
- Outlier detection and removal.
- Data transformation and feature engineering.
